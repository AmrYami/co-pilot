    tokens_groups is a list of groups. Each group is ORed inside, ANDed between groups if len>1.
    Example:
        [["it"], ["home care"]] â†’ (group1) OR (group2)  (if caller wants OR between groups)
        For AND behavior, caller should pass AND-mode; here we only build per-group OR block.
    We will return a generic AND over groups; caller decides to OR or AND by how he passes groups.
    For simplicity: we AND between groups (each group can contain multiple tokens ORed).
    If you want OR-between-groups, pass a single group with all tokens.
